# exchanger

I will be creating a visual currency exchange graph that gets data from the exchangeratesapi.io API (JSON https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest).

The visualization will be done through bar charts using html, css, and react

For now you can select a base currency and a comparison currency. The React side also uses components. There is a known bug that the bar becomes much too large when the currency comparisons are too large.

Color Scheme:
#F0F8FF
#00688B
#64c4ed
#4f81c7
